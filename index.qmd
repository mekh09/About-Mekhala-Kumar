Hi, I am Mekhala Kumar! 
I am interested in a job where I can apply data visualisation and analysis techniques to social concerns like gender inequality. I am drawn towards reducing gender inequality because I have noticed how it affects educational institutions and the workplace. I have a background in Applied Mathematics and Economics and am currently pursuing Data Analytics and Computational Social Science at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Additionally, I have been practicing Karate for over a decade and hold a second DAN black belt, which has enhanced my leadership and concentration skills. To know more about me, click below:
